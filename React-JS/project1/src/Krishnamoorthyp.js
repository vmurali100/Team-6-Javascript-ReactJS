    <h3> Trees are our best friends</h3>
    <p>
    Trees are our best friends because they clean the air we breathe. 
    Likewise, they also clean the water and soil and ultimately make the earth a better place. It is also a fact that 
    people who live near trees are healthier, fit, and happier than people who do not.

    <h3>About tree</h3>
        <p>
        Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have 
        independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants 
        to compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods.

        <h3>special tree</h3>
        <p>
        Trees are vital. As the biggest plants on the planet, 
        they give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilise the soil and give life to the world's wildlife. 
        They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter.
