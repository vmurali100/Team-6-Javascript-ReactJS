        <h3>dolphin be a good pet</h3>
        <p>Despite what dolphinaria may have you believe, dolphins are apex ocean predators,
             capable of even killing sharks, and should be treated as such. Dolphins can be 
             aggressive to people, other dolphins, or even self-harm. While the majority of 
             dolphins in the U.S. are bred in captivity, they are not domesticated animals</p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Do dolphins like humans</h3>
        <p>Dolphins have a reputation for being friendly, but they are actually wild animals
             who should be treated with caution and respect. Interactions with people change
              dolphin behavior for the worse. They lose their natural wariness, which makes 
              them easy targets for vandalism and shark attack.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Is a dolphin a fish or a mammal</h3>
        <p>Even though they live in the ocean all of the time, dolphins are mammals,
             not fish. Like every mammal, dolphins are warm blooded. Unlike fish, who 
             breathe through gills, dolphins breathe air using lungs.</p>
