            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. <br/><br/>
            
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br/><br/> 
            
            It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br/><br/> 
            
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br/><br/>

            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br/><br/>

            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<br/><br/>

            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard lib.<br/><br/>
