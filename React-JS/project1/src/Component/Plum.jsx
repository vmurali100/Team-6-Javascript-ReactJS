        <p>A plum is a fruit of some species in Prunus subg. Prunus. 
            Mature plum fruits may have a dusty-white waxy coating that 
            gives them a glaucous appearance. 
            This is an epicuticular wax coating and is known as "wax bloom".
             Dried plums are called prunes, which have a dark, wrinkled appearance. </p>
