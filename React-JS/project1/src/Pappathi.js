        <h3>Blessing of home</h3>
        <p>It is my parents hard work that has given us this blessing. 
            Many people in todays world are always complaining about the 
            things they dont have. The person who has a house wants a bungalow. 
            The one who owns a bungalow wants a palace. The one living in a palace wants an island. This never-ending cycle goes on. However, if we look at the people below us rather than those who are above us, we will be happier.</p>

        <h3>Beautefull house</h3>
        <p>My house has very high ceilings as it was made many years back. 
            It has vintage switchboards which give it a very unique look. 
            My house is situated in the middle of four roads. 
            It is not joined to any other house. 
            My house has four entrances from each side.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>My House</h3>
        <p>I live in my ancestral home with my grandparents, parents, and siblings. 
            My grandfather built this house with his hard work. 
            It has four rooms, one kitchen, two bathrooms, and a patio. 
            My house is at least fifty years old.</p>
