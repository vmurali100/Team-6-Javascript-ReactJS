        <h2>Reduces stress</h2>
        <p>Stress reduction is one of the most common reasons people try meditation.
One review concluded that meditation lives up to its reputation for stress reduction (1Trusted Source).
Normally, mental and physical stress cause increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. 
This produces many of the harmful effects of stress, such as the release of inflammatory 
chemicals called cytokines.</p><br></br>
        <h2> Controls anxiety</h2>
        <p>Meditation can reduce stress levels, which translates to less anxiety.
A meta-analysis including nearly 1,300 adults found that meditation may decrease anxiety. Notably, this effect 
was strongest in those with the highest levels of anxiety (6Trusted Source).
Also, one study found that 8 weeks of mindfulness meditation helped reduce anxiety symptoms in people with generalized anxiety disorder, 
along with increasing positive self-statements and improving stress reactivity and coping</p><br></br>
        <h2>Promotes emotional health</h2>
        <p>Some forms of meditation can lead to improved self-image and a more positive outlook on life.
For example, one review of treatments given to more than 
3,500 adults found that mindfulness meditation improved symptoms of depression (12Trusted Source).
Similarly, a review of 18 studies showed that people receiving meditation therapies 
experienced reduced symptoms of depression, compared with those in a control group</p><br></br>
        <h2>Enhances self-awareness</h2>
        <p>Some forms of meditation may help you develop a stronger understanding of yourself, helping you grow into your best self.
For example, self-inquiry meditation explicitly aims to help you develop a greater understanding of yourself and how you relate to those around you.
Other forms teach you to recognize thoughts that may be harmful or self-defeating. The idea is that as you gain greater 
awareness of your thought habits, you can steer them toward more constructive patterns </p>
